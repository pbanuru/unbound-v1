## What Was Just Completed

### Session: 2025-10-18 Afternoon - Infrastructure Setup

**Completed**:
1. ‚úÖ **Project Documentation**:
   - Analyzed existing research sessions (3 sessions on voice conversion)
   - Researched async collaboration best practices for AI-human research
   - Created CLAUDE.md - Complete AI researcher guide
   - Created RESEARCH_PLAN.md - 12-week research roadmap
   - Created HANDOFF.md - Async communication protocol
   - Created supporting docs (experiments/README.md, data/README.md, research_logs/README.md)
   - Created first research log (research_logs/2025-10/2025-10-18.md)

2. ‚úÖ **Folder Structure**:
   - Created all project folders (docs/, experiments/, data/, src/, configs/, results/, scripts/, paper/)
   - Set up .gitignore for large files
   - Git commits for all setup work

3. ‚úÖ **GCP/GCS Setup**:
   - Created GCP project: `unbound-v1`
   - Linked billing account (YN Billing Account)
   - Created GCS bucket: `gs://unbound-v1-data/`
   - Location: us-west1 (California region)
   - Storage class: STANDARD
   - Documented bucket details in data/README.md and CLAUDE.md

4. ‚úÖ **VCTK Dataset Download** (IN PROGRESS):
   - Started download: VCTK-Corpus-0.92.zip (10.9GB)
   - Using curl (server doesn't support parallel downloads)
   - Download speed: ramped up to 13+ MB/s
   - Progress as of 16:03: ~7-8GB downloaded, ~14 min remaining
   - Background process running (bash ID: ad13d1)

**Key Decisions Made**:
- Budget corrected to $4971 (from $5000)
- Using markdown + git for tracking (not W&B initially)
- GCS bucket in us-west1 (California) instead of multi-region
- Phase 0 focus on strategic research before coding

**Files Created/Modified**:
- CLAUDE.md, RESEARCH_PLAN.md, HANDOFF.md
- data/README.md, experiments/README.md, research_logs/README.md
- research_logs/2025-10/2025-10-18.md
- .gitignore (updated)
- Git commits: 3 total

## What Needs to Be Done Next

### Priority: HIGH üî¥

1. **[AI - NEXT SESSION]** Complete VCTK dataset setup
   - **Status**: Download running in background (curl, bash ID: ad13d1)
   - **Next steps**:
     - Check if download completed
     - Unzip VCTK-Corpus-0.92.zip
     - Upload to gs://unbound-v1-data/data/raw/VCTK/
     - Verify dataset integrity
     - Document in data/README.md

2. **[AI]** Run Deep Research: Seed-VC Architecture
   - **Query**: "Seed-VC claims 0.8676 similarity and 11.99% WER. What is their exact architecture, training recipe, and datasets? What are known weaknesses or failure cases? What architectural improvements have been proposed since their publication?"
   - **Purpose**: Understand SOTA before designing our approach
   - **Output**: Save to `docs/seed_vc_analysis.md`
   - **Timeline**: This week (Phase 0)
   - **Time**: ~10-15 minutes

3. **[AI]** Run Deep Research: Data Strategy
   - **Query**: "For training a one-shot voice conversion model, compare VCTK, LibriTTS, and AISHELL-3 in terms of: speaker diversity, recording quality, speaking style variety, and suitability for generalization. What data augmentation strategies are most effective?"
   - **Purpose**: Choose optimal dataset(s) for training
   - **Output**: Update `data/README.md` with findings
   - **Timeline**: This week (Phase 0)

### Priority: MEDIUM üü°

4. **[AI]** Architecture Comparison Analysis
   - **Task**: Compare diffusion vs flow vs GAN decoders for voice conversion
   - **Include**: WavLM vs HuBERT vs Whisper for content encoding
   - **Output**: Write `docs/architecture.md` with trade-offs
   - **Timeline**: This week (Phase 0)

5. **[AI]** Draft Architecture Proposal
   - **Task**: 1-page proposal with design decisions and rationale
   - **Include**: Content encoder, style encoder, decoder, losses, training strategy
   - **Include**: Budget estimate for experiments
   - **Output**: Add to RESEARCH_PLAN.md or separate doc
   - **Requires**: Human review and approval before implementation

### Priority: LOW üü¢

6. **[HUMAN - PENDING]** Modal Credentials Verification
   - **What**: Confirm Claude can run `modal run` commands
   - **Why**: Need GPU compute for experiments ($4971 budget)
   - **Blocking**: All GPU experiments (Phase 1+)
   - **Status**: Not yet verified

---

## Current Blockers / Decisions Needed

### Blockers

1. ~~**[RESOLVED]** GCS bucket setup~~ ‚úÖ
   - **Resolution**: Created `gs://unbound-v1-data/` in us-west1
   - **Project**: unbound-v1 (with YN Billing Account)
   - **Details**: See data/README.md

2. **[BLOCKING PHASE 1+]** Modal credentials
   - **Impact**: Cannot run GPU experiments
   - **Owner**: Human
   - **Urgency**: Medium (need before Phase 1 Week 2-3)
   - **Note**: Can do Phase 0 research without this

### Decisions Needed

1. **[STRATEGIC]** Research vs Implementation Balance
   - **Question**: How much time in Phase 0? Deep research can take hours.
   - **Context**: 1 week planned, but can adjust
   - **Your input**: Stick with 1 week of research, or move faster?

2. **[STRATEGIC]** Paper Target Venue
   - **Question**: Arxiv only, or submit to conference (ICASSP, Interspeech)?
   - **Context**: Affects rigor and timeline requirements
   - **Your input**: What's the publication goal?

3. **[PRACTICAL]** Quality vs Speed Priority
   - **Question**: If forced to choose, prioritize quality or inference speed?
   - **Context**: Diffusion (higher quality, slower) vs Flow (good quality, faster)
   - **Your input**: Which matters more for this project?

---

## Questions / Observations

### Questions for Human

1. Do you have a Modal account already? Are $4971 credits already loaded?
2. Any time constraints on the 12-week timeline?
3. Preference for inference speed vs quality if tradeoff needed?

### Observations

- GCS bucket setup went smoothly
- VCTK download accelerated nicely (13+ MB/s after slow start)
- Project has ~78GB local disk space (plenty for work)
- The existing research sessions (DeepResearcher) are extremely high quality
- We have solid understanding of the problem space from prior research
- Phase 0 (research) will be low-cost but time-intensive
- Budget ($4971) should be sufficient for 12-week plan if managed carefully
