so I want to build a cutting edge single-shot voice conversion model. i.e. Like RVC but single shot. Need to be leading. And we need to know the competitors and how to evaluate against them. And we need to learn how to beat them. Will need to rely on an open source dataset. This model will be open source via apache.

Would you be able to build a highly detailed prompt which I can send to an AI agent?
Desired output: a very well thought out research prompt.
