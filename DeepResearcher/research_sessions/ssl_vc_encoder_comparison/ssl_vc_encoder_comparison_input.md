For voice conversion content encoders, compare WavLM, HuBERT, and Whisper-based approaches. For each SSL (self-supervised learning) model, analyze: (1) content representation quality and phonetic information preservation, (2) speaker information leakage and disentanglement capability, (3) robustness to accents, noise, and speaking style variations, (4) computational efficiency and latency, (5) performance on one-shot voice conversion benchmarks. What are best practices for using these models in VC as of 2024-2025? Which layer representations work best?
