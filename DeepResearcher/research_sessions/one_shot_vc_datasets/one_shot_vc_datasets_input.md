For training a state-of-the-art one-shot voice conversion model, compare VCTK, LibriTTS, and AISHELL-3 datasets in terms of: (1) speaker diversity (number of speakers, gender balance, age range), (2) recording quality and consistency, (3) speaking style variety (read speech vs conversational), (4) suitability for generalization to unseen speakers, and (5) any known issues or biases. Additionally, what data augmentation strategies (pitch shifting, time stretching, noise injection, room simulation, etc.) are most effective for improving one-shot voice conversion model robustness and generalization?
